# Password-generator
For this project, I created a password generator that prompts a user to pick the length and whether they want their password to have letters (both upper and/or lower case), numbers, and/or special characters. If the user picks a length outside of the range of 8-128 characters, or doesn't pick any of the options for password characters, the user will receive error messages. The length and chosen characters are stored as variables, and those are used in a random password generator to give a unique password everytime you click 'Generate'.

Below I have attached screenshots of my deployed application. 1st picture is of the landing page, 2nd picture of the user being prompted, and the 3rd of the generated password.
